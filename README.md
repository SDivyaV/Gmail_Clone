**Gmail Clone**
This Gmail clone project is a web application built with React, Redux, and Firebase. 
It replicates the core functionality of composing and viewing emails in a minimalistic, Gmail-inspired interface. Users can compose emails, view a list of composed messages, and have the messages stored in Firebase as a database.

**FEATURES**
Compose Emails: Users can compose new emails with a rich-text editor, enabling an interactive user experience.
View Sent Messages: All sent messages are stored in Firebase and displayed on the screen, allowing users to view their messages history.
Data Persistence with Firebase: Emails are stored in Firebase's real-time database for persistent access across sessions.
State Management with Redux: Redux is used for managing application state, ensuring smooth, predictable user interactions.

**Technologies Used**
React for building user interfaces.
Redux for managing application state.
Firebase for authentication, database storage, and hosting.

Thus this clone is a simple replication of the Gmail using React,Redux and Firebase.
